*Introduction:*

Author: Tayler Kordiak

Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) are an aggressive bivalve invasive species that dominate and alter the freshwater ecosystems they invade. This benthic species, meaning living on the bottom of a body of water [@merriamwebster_benthic], often affects trophic levels by destroying ecosystem processes [@karatayev2002impacts]. Some ecosystem processes that are affected include oxygen and nutrient availability, sedimentation rates, and increased water temperature which can lead to a reduction of native species, due to outcompeting, that are detrimental to the freshwater ecosystems they belong to. Along with affecting the lake species, it also causes human problems economically and recreationally. Zebra mussels coined the term “biofouling” meaning that they attach to any hard surface such as rocks, boats, and docks because of their byssal threads [@nps_zebramussels_2025]. These mussels may not affect boats in the water for short trips, however, when these things are left in infested water for long periods, like power plant water intakes, it can cause millions of dollars in damage [@usgs_zebramussels_2025]. Zebra mussels were first brought into the United States in the mid-1980s, and it is hypothesized that they were brought from a cargo ship that ported in the St. Claire River, which connects Lake Erie and Lake Huron. The cargo ship, coming from Europe, dumped its ballast water which in turn dumped the organisms from the freshwater ports in Russia and Ukraine that they are native to. They were first discovered in Lake St. Claire, and quickly spread to the St. Croix and Mississippi Rivers naturally, and further to the west through human transport on boats [@nps_zebramussels_2025]. Currently, there are some preventative measures for halting the spread of infested waters to non-infested waters such as ensuring personal recreation equipment such as boats, jet skis, and trailers for these items are cleaned, drained, and well-dried before leaving the boat launch. During high-traffic months, there will typically be a USGS or State Department of Natural Resources monitor to inspect the boats that come in and out of the lakes to ensure that the proper safety measures are taken. This process includes inspecting equipment and removing any visible mussels, however, this may be difficult due to their small size, and draining live wells, bilges, and bait buckets of any water before departing. As an owner of this type of recreational equipment, it’s also your duty to ensure that your items are completely dry and washed before entering another body of water [@ca_water_mussels_2019]. 

Some current control methods are rapid response agencies, public education through signage and monitors at boat launches, as well as some physical, biological, and chemical controls. An example of a physical control measure is water drawdowns in canals and aqueducts which can dry and kill zebra mussels. There is ongoing biological research to determine the natural killers of zebra mussels, and the control measure that our group is interested in researching further is the chemical component that is being taken to kill off these mussels. The research question that we will be testing within the program R is, does the concentration of Zequanox in Round Lake and other lake plays a role in the mortality of zebra mussels. Zequanox is a natural, non-chemical pesticide that helps to control the spread of two types of mussels, one of them being zebra mussels. It is a naturally occurring soil microbe that disrupts the mussels' digestive system. One lake is not currently being treated with Zequanox, while the other lake is being treated, and we want to compare a non-treated lake with a treated one to see the success of the Zequanox.  The data that will be used comes from blank, which is a trusted website and displays public natural resource information for Round Lake in Michigan, specifically, Zequanox concentrations and zebra mussel density as well as mortality. For the other lake, we are going to be using this data which is also public data that comes from here and supplies the zebra mussel density and mortality. We wanted to pick two lakes within the same state to ensure similar climate, topography, and prevention measures on the bodies of water with zebra mussels. As for the methods, we will be using a log regression, decision tree, or random forest which will help us view the success of Zequanox in Round Lake compared to other lake. We will start with our full data, and pull out a sample of the data to be our training set. With the training set we will be able to create reasamples such as a 10-fold cross-validation to compare the different models listed above to see which model best fits our data. Ensuring that each model has a specified model and engine. Once ranked, we will be able to decide which model we will use to show the density and mortality of zebra mussels within both lakes in Michigan. 

*Data Exploration:*

Author: Brittany Bobb and Austin Sharrah 

Utilizing the datasheets located through the USGS publication on the Assessment of uncontained Zequanox applications in a Midwestern Lake, we intend to compare the mortality rate of the Zebra Mussels within Pound Lake against those in an untreated reference lake to determine Zequanox’s effectiveness. The data provides additional information that allows us to compare the mortality rate against the concentrations within each zone of Pound Lake, deepening our understanding of this treatment's effectiveness. This data set is spatially correlated focusing specifically on Zequanox concentrations, Zebra Mussel morality, mussel density, water chemistry, and native mussels. Within the Zequanox concentration data sheet, the treatment type, plot number, zones, concentration, replication, time, and date are included. The mortality rate datasheet includes the treatment type, plot number, replications, and mussel population numbers which include moralities. While much of the data has been put together in an easy way to comprehend, there is still some data cleaning that needs to be done, such as removing duplicates, standardizing formats, and addressing missing values. Additionally, certain outliers may need to be reviewed to ensure they are accurately represented. These steps will help improve the quality of the data, making sure that any analysis or insights from it are as accurate and reliable as possible.
	We believe we have found that the concentration of the Zequanox seems to have a positive correlation with the mortality rate within the zebra mussel population. Zones with higher concentrations of the treatment appear to show increased mussel mortality, indicating a dose-dependent relationship as well. However, further statistical analysis is needed to confirm the strength and consistency of this pattern. Additionally, we identified that the method of application—specifically whether the treatment was contained or uncontained—along with the rate at which the chemical dispersed throughout the water, plays a significant role in determining overall effectiveness. These factors may influence not only how the chemical interacts with the target species, but also how uniformly it is distributed across treatment zones.

This study will use a combination of geospatial analysis and statistical modeling to evaluate the effectiveness of zebra mussel control measures across two different midwestern U.S. lakes. The primary lake, Pound Lake, is treated using Zequanox, and will be compared with another nearby untreated lake. Geospatial data from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), specifically datasets tracking zebra mussel presence and the application of control methods, will be central to the analysis. We will map changes in zebra mussel distribution over a five-year period (2018–2023) and apply regression analysis to examine the statistical relationship between treatment efforts and observed changes in mussel populations. Temporal trends will also be assessed to evaluate the long-term impact of control interventions.

Several challenges may arise during this study, such as inconsistencies in data collection methods across our two different lakes may introduce variability in the dataset, while gaps in monitoring records could limit the thoroughness of the analysis. Additionally, external ecological variables—such as temperature, pH, and water flow—may provide confounding variables within the relationship between treatments and outcomes. To address these challenges, we will implement data cleaning protocols and perform sensitivity analyses to test the strength of our results.

To enhance the accuracy and depth of our analysis, we will incorporate supplemental data from a few other sources. Water quality indicators from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will provide important context on the ecological conditions of each lake, while climate data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will help account for broader environmental trends if the lakes are further apart. State and local reports will be used to form a more detailed understanding of specific control efforts. Together, these methods and data sources will allow for a complete evaluation of treatment effectiveness and environmental factors influencing zebra mussel populations.
